# ArrayComparision
This program investigates whether array's or ArrayList's are faster in the operations: fill, incriment, and search. It does this by seeing the amount of time needed in order for the two variable types to preform each function. Run the ArrayComparison file to execute.


Typical Results/Output:
Fill race, N = 10,000,000
array fill:     1.57 seconds
ArrayList fill: 2.18 seconds

Increment race, N = 10,000,000
array increment:     0.24 seconds
ArrayList increment: 0.82 seconds

Search race, N = 10,000,000
array search:     0.02 seconds
ArrayList search: 2.74 seconds

Expand race, N = 5,000,000
array w/o expansion:      2.45 seconds
ArrayList with expansion: 3.33 seconds

Conclusion: Arrays run these functions faster than ArrayLists
